    <h1>Beginning Of Ixal.</h1>
    <p>
The start of Ixal
Ixal was made by a gamer by the name of RuiIsHere. and invited zeus (kawata0210).

RuiIsHere's spawn marked the commencement of Ixal. He cut up some stone and wood. And while Rui is flattening the base, kawata0210 was invited, and kawata produced some basewalls. 
after building the base. Kawata engages in mining. During Rui's wood-chopping.

The creator of The Dirt Castle, also known as Yumi Yzaae, was then invited; she can be found on Rui's Twitter. The first owner of a diamond helmet is yzaae. He got it from Rui.

ApartImpala8869, commonly known as yuan, was also invited by Rui. Yuan has the lowest stack since he tends to play inconsistently.

when Yzaae and Kawata were grinding.
For the players, Rui made a mob farm.
also visible on rui's twitter.

The following day
Rui is becoming bored in the base since the creation of the mob farm. So he went exploring to build a new base! The Bonebreaker base's offspring

But Rui has been working hard first.
For his pals, he dug some iron and diamond. Rui was prepared to build the base once he had a full diamond set.

Zeus desired the base to be called Bonebreaker, therefore it was given that name.

Zeus and Rui are the base's founders.
Because KirioIsHere, also known as my sibling, and Zeus both contributed significantly to its creation.

After that, the work was completed in 3 days.
